<p><small></small>Here is an excellent <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2012/11/is-open-theism-a-type-of-arminianism/">post by my good friend Roger Olson</a> in which he makes the case that Open Theism should be embraced by Arminians as an orthodox, if somewhat non-traditional, form of their faith. In fact, Roger argues (rightly in my opinion) that Open Theism is much closer to the “heart” of Arminianism than is Molinism.</p>
<p>I would like to add one thing to Roger’s insightful essay. My friend Tom Luckashow has amassed a wealth of evidence that demonstrates that many early Arminians, especially among the Methodists, were Open Theists (though they of course didn’t identify themselves with this label). Tom has graciously made copies of every one of his findings, and the material stands in a stack over three feet tall! Beyond showing that Open Theism is not nearly as recent as most seem to believe, this material demonstrates that, while this view was vigorously debated at various times from the early 17th century up through the early 20th century, the orthodoxy of Open Theism was never questioned by other Arminians, at least so far as we’ve been able to determine.</p>
<p>One significant indication of the prevalence of Open Theism among early Aminianism is John Owen’s famous book, <em>A Display of Arminianism </em>(1642). At one point Owen, a staunch Calvinist, argues against an early 17th century Arminian named Covinus by saying that he and his camp “affirm that God is said properly to expect and desire divers things which never come to pass.”<a title="" href="#_edn1">[i]</a> Another early 17th century Arminian that Owen argues against is Conrad Vortius, whom Owen sarcastically describes as a ”great prophet” among Arminians and as one of “their chiefest patriarches.” Owen says Vortius believes “[t]hat God oftentimes feareth, that is, suspecteth…and prudently conjectureth, that this or that evil may arise.” Owen also describes those who believe along the lines of Vortius as espousing the view that, “God doth often intend what he doth not foresee will come to pass” and that “the hope and expectation of God is deceived by man.” Owen goes so far as to grant that “the strength of their strongest argument lies in this, that God hoped and expected obedience from Israel” –an expectation that failed come to pass.</p>
<p>While we haven’t yet been able to track down the original references of Covinus and Vortius, we have the original writings of a multitude of others who espouse the Open View, or something quite like it, and who indicate this view was not rare in Arminian circles and was not viewed with any suspicion. One particular noteworthy advocate is Samuel Fancourt who defended this view in a dozen or so books and tracts in the mid-17th century. There were numerous essays and books – several of which are massive &#8212; written to refute Fancourt’s stance, and they in various ways indicate that this view was widespread and (to their chagrin) accepted as a viable option by Arminians. The same is true of a half dozen essays defending or interacting with the Open View in <em>The Arminian Magazine </em>between 1780 and 1785. Significantly enough, the founder and editor of this magazine was none other than John Wesley.</p>
<p>There were numerous defenders of the Open View throughout the 19th century as well. For example, it was brilliantly defended in the <em>Memoirs </em>of Billy Hibbard, a highly revered early 19th century Methodists circuit preacher. An even more famous defender was L.D. McCabe, president of Oberlin College, who wrote two works on the topic in the last quarter of this century. His work was challenged by a multitude of others, and while these debates were lively, we have found no evidence that any Arminian questioned McCabe’s orthodoxy. On top of this, Tom Luckashow has found a dozen or so entries in a journal entitled <em>The Microcosm: The Organ of Substantial Philosophy </em>that further demonstrates that the Open View was prevalent and widely accepted in Arminian &#8212; and especially Weslyan &#8212; circles in the 1880’s. And, finally, T.W. Brents’ work, <em>The Gospel Plan of Salvation,</em> published in 1874 and widely used as a theological textbook within the Restorationist movement (Disciples of Christ) throughout the latter part of the 19th century, makes the Open View a foundational aspect of his theology. We again find contemporaries pushing back on his view, but to date, we find no one calling Brent’s orthodoxy to account on this basis.</p>
<p>These findings (and by the way, Tom and I feel we are thus far just scratching the surface!) demonstrate that, not only is it arbitrary for contemporary Arminians to resist embracing Open Theism, as Roger argues, it is also against their own tradition. With Roger, I believe it is time for Arminians to return to the irenic spirit of their tradition. Open Theists share the “the heart” of Arminianism, especially as it concerns the loving character of God. We simply believe that, when worked out consistently, core Arminian convictions, as well as a wealth of biblical material, implies that the future includes unsettled possibilities that will only become settled facts – and thus known by God as settled facts – when free agents transition them into facts by their free decisions.</p>

<p><a title="" href="#_ednref1">[i]</a> I apologize for the fact that I am working from copies of materials that do not include the page numbers of the works cited, and I do not presently have the time to hunt them down. I’d also like to add that Tom and I are in the initial stages of planning a manuscript that would review the writings of Open Theists from the Reformation period through the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>Several days ago we posted “<a href="http://reknew.org/2012/11/a-song-to-remember/">A song for sparrows</a>,” and judging from the feedback, it seems that it landed on many of you the way it landed on us. One person described it as “the most beautiful song in the world!” The song is performed and written by Jessica Smith. She belongs to the duo <em>Eustace the Dragon</em> along with Danny Churchill. Both are dear friends of mine. The name <em>Eustace the Dragon</em> refers to the episode in C. S. Lewis’ <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em> in which a young boy (Eustace) gets freed from his dragon form by Aslan, the great Lion. It’s a beautiful, moving tale of redemption, which this duo’s music is all about.</p>
<p>Here is another song sung by Jessica called “First.” There’s something about this song that strikes me as other-worldly. I’ve listened to it a dozen times, and there’s one moment at which the sound Jessica captures is so completely unique, it makes me laugh every time. I’ve honestly never heard anything quite like it.  I think you’ll enjoy it as well.</p>
<p><em>Eustace the Dragon</em> has begun to make their <a href="http://soundcloud.com/jessica-smith-15/tracks">songs available for free on SoundCloud</a>. If you choose to download them, they ask that you email them at WeAreEustace@gmail.com (all e-mail addresses will be kept completely private). They would just like to know who is listening to their music and would like to inform fans about upcoming shows and albums.</p>
<p>Speaking of upcoming shows, if you’re around the Twin Cities, <em>Eustace the Dragon</em> will be performing at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Groundswell-Coffee/105827936115782?fref=ts">Groundswell Coffee</a>  in St. Paul, on Tuesday, November 20th, with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEpdbWyCyWU&amp;noredirect=1">Sarah and Johnny Becker</a> opening for them at 7 pm. This delightful coffee shop is run by <a href="http://www.thirdwaychurch.org/about-us/">Thirdway Church</a>, a great Mennonite community that my daughter and son-in-law attend and that is headed up by my friend Seth McCoy. If you live in the area and are looking for an authentic kingdom community, I encourage you to check it out.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy their music and hope you tell your friends about them. I’d love to see this unique, anointed and beautiful music bless millions!</p>
<p>Greg</p>

What is God calling you to pour yourself into and what is getting in the way?</p>
<p>From the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s true: world wants you to be distracted as all get-out, to flitter and flutter until we are too tired to do much use. World wants you to bounce around social media, gracing everyone with your thoughts on every little thing. World wants you to watch stupid shows about inane people experiencing one trivial problem after another, wants us to think it hilarious when people consistently fail to engage each other on a deep level. World wants you to buy more, on trend, on sale, because the faster you buy the less you care about the hands that make. World wants you to be a consumer, preferably seven days a week.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>As we continue our series on the beatitudes, we find an increasing understanding of what it means to be a follower of Jesus. In this sermon, Greg talks about mercy and being pure in heart. He also shows how God doesn’t reward us for being merciful and being pure in heart, but there are natural, good consequences in doing these things.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s a song that a friend of ours from <a href="http://www.thirdwaychurch.org/about-us/">Third Way Church</a> wrote that you might want to listen to today of all days. It&#8217;s based on Psalm 84. If you&#8217;re feeling anxious, remember that we are loved and cared for and safe.</p>

<p>A Song for Sparrows</p>
<p>Even a sparrow<br />
calls your house her home<br />
A lowly swallow her nest<br />
for better is a place<br />
near you</p>
<p>See the pilgrim<br />
set her heart for home.<br />
The rains will follow her steps<br />
and bless her strength to strength.</p>
<p>How lovely, how lovely are you.<br />
How lovely, how lovely, Your voice, Your face.<br />
How lovely, how lovely.</p>
<p>I keep the door<br />
to call your house a home.<br />
A lowly fellow to rest<br />
for better is one day,<br />
better is one day<br />
with you.<br />
Better is one day<br />
with you.</p>

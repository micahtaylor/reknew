			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://biologos.org/blog">Biologos</a> posted a three part reflection on <a href="http://biologos.org/blog/series/pre-modern-readings-on-genesis-1">Pre-Modern readings of Genesis 1</a> that are worth a closer look. And no matter what your particular way of reading this portion of Scripture, let&#8217;s pay attention to what edifies the Church and whether our reading contributes to that.</p>
<p>From Part I of the series:</p>
<blockquote><p>Key theologians of the early church (such as Origen and Augustine, as we’ve discussed) read Scripture with multiple senses and meanings—with a literal sense and multiple spiritual senses. However, not all fully agreed with this methodology. Though most all would certainly hold to multiple senses of Scripture, some readers insisted upon a more profound attention to the literal sense, and the use of the literal sense to help restrain or hold in check the possible spiritual readings. Such 3rd- and 4th-century Church fathers, as St. Basil the Great, John Chrysostom, St. Ambrose, and Theodore of Mopsuestia insisted upon a much more restrained literal reading of Genesis 1.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Yet even those who insist upon a more literal—or more historical—interpretation of Genesis 1 still contended that the primary purpose of any reading was to edify the Church, which entails setting forth the key theological teachings of Genesis 1, rather than focus on the material specifics. Again, such teachings include that the world is created, that God create the world out of nothing, and that the creation account demonstrates the great order and harmony of creation as a testimony of the God’s glory, beauty, and goodness.<sup>7</sup></p></blockquote>

<p>The New York Times recently posted <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/sep/27/philosopher-defends-religion/?pagination=false">a review</a> of Alvin Plantinga&#8217;s book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199812098?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thneyoreofbo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0199812098" target="_blank">Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism</a>. </em>In it, Plantinga argues on philosophical grounds that, among other things, theism is not in conflict with science, that a belief in naturalism along with evolution is contradictory, and that &#8220;Faith&#8230;is another basic way of forming beliefs, distinct from but not in competition with reason, perception, memory, and the others.&#8221; It&#8217;s a dense, but great read. The video above is a short interview with Plantinga that is also illuminating.</p>
<p>From the book review:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plantinga holds that miracles are not incompatible with the laws of physics, because those laws determine only what happens in closed systems, without external intervention, and the proposition that the physical universe is a closed system is not itself a law of physics, but a naturalist assumption. Newton did not believe it: he even believed that God intervened to keep the planets in their orbits. Plantinga has a lengthy discussion of the relation of miracles to quantum theory: its probabilistic character, he believes, may allow not only miracles but human free will. And he considers the different interpretations that have been given to the fine-tuning of the physical constants, concluding that the support it offers for theism is modest, because of the difficulty of assigning probabilities to the alternatives. All these discussions make a serious effort to engage with the data of current science. The arguments are often ingenious and, given Plantinga’s premises, the overall view is thorough and consistent.</p>
<p>The interest of this book, especially for secular readers, is its presentation from the inside of the point of view of a philosophically subtle and scientifically informed theist—an outlook with which many of them will not be familiar. Plantinga writes clearly and accessibly, and sometimes acidly—in response to aggressive critics of religion like Dawkins and Daniel Dennett. His comprehensive stand is a valuable contribution to this debate.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.religiondispatches.org/contributors/andrewaghapour/">Andrew Aghapour</a> wrote an article that was posted in <a href="http://www.religiondispatches.org/">Religion Dispatches</a> questioning the findings of studies that concluded that analytical thinking negatively affects religious belief. In the article, <a href="http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/science/5991/does_analytic_thinking_erode_religious_belief">Does Analytic Thinking Erodes Religious Belief?</a> Aghapour argues that there are flaws in the studies and that the biggest culprit was the most likely the population used for the studies. It&#8217;s a good reminder that we need to be using our analytic brains when we encounter claims like these.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like the zombies that populate our screens, Americans have an immense appetite for brains. Most of the above stories come from just the past month, and they are only a small sample of neuroscience’s prominent circulation in the news cycle. Neuroscience can tell us who we are, how we can improve ourselves, and why other people act in the strange ways that they do. In an increasingly complex world, brains seem to somehow point back to the one thing that all humans have in common.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the high demand for news about the brain, media coverage of neuroscience is notoriously sketchy. In a recent <a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273%2812%2900330-3?large_figure=true" target="_blank">article</a> in the journal <em>Neuron</em>, the authors lament the ways that popular neuroscience is used to artificially “underline differences between categories of people in ways that [are] symbolically layered and socially loaded.” In other words, research about the brain is often stretched and extended to support existing stereotypes about race, sex, class, and religion. Neuroscience is new enough, and our desire for brain facts is strong enough, that dubious claims about brain types circulate widely.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m not a scientist, but I’ve always loved to dabble in it. In fact, I collaborated with some friends and wrote a quirky picture book on the interfacing of various areas of science (e.g. quantum theory, chaos theory) and the open view of the future. It’s called <em>The Cosmic Dance</em> and, just to let the cat a little bit out of the bag, at some point in the future we’ll be offering it to friends of ReKnew <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>In any event, over the last couple of years, and especially through my participation in <a href="http://biologos.org/">BioLogos</a>, I’ve developed a special appreciation for the way some scientists who are Bible-believing Christians see and express the glory of God in the evolution of the cosmos and of humanity. I especially love the way some articulate creation as a sort of open-ended adventure, even for God. These scientists see the beauty and grandeur of the creation unfolding, with a delicate balance of order and spontaneity permeating everything. From the quantum particle to human beings to the universe itself, every distinct thing, and everything in relation to every other thing, is a marvelous dance of structure and freedom!</p>
<p>A scientist who captures these ideas beautifully is Karl Giberson, one of the scientists who heads up BioLogos. Here is <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/takeandread/2012/09/a-glorious-universe-inspiring-adventures-of-the-spirit/">a little reflection by Bruce Epperly on his new book, <em>Seven Glorious Days</em></a>. I haven’t yet read the book, but this reflection makes me want to.  Keep dancing!</p>
<p>From the book review:</p>
<blockquote><p>There need not be competition between people of faith and scientists.  In fact, if the early Christian declaration that “wherever truth is found, God is its source” reflects God’s inspiration of all quests to understand the universe, then people of faith should train their eyes to see God’s presence in the laboratory, the Hubble telescope, the Higgs Boson, the fossil field, and the medical theatre as well as the meditation hall and sanctuary.  Perhaps Robert Jastrow is correct when he notes:</p>
<p><em>For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends</em></p>
<p><em>like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer</em></p>
<p><em>the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of</em></p>
<p><em>theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.</em></p>
<p>Yet it may not be such a bad dream, but the discovery that our adventures of the spirit – motivated by wonder and the desire to know – are blessed activities, witnessing to a Wisdom beyond and within that embraces and inspires every quest for truth.  Scientists and people of faith can venture forth, seeing the world through the lenses of each discipline, and joining in common cause to heal this good earth.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>We received an unusual amount of e-mail and quite a few comments on my Facebook page in response to my little post on evolution a few days ago. I appreciate all of it, including the critical comments. Thank you!</p>
<p>As I reflect on my post in light of this feedback, I can see that I assumed too much and thus said too little. Several people correctly pointed out that the word &#8220;Evolution&#8221; is ambiguous. For example, does believing in evolution entail the acceptance of &#8220;abiogenesis&#8221; -that is, the conviction that life spontaneously arose by strictly natural means (that is, without divine influence) out of non-living matter? Does believing in evolution imply that one accepts that all forms of life, including humans, evolved by natural processes <em>alone</em> (e.g. spontaneous mutations, cataclysmic environmental alterations, natural selection, etc.)? Could one be said to embrace evolution if they believe that the process involved divine guidance, at least in the sense that God originally designed nature such that life would evolve in a way that led to the creation of <em>homo sapiens</em>? Is it consistent with evolution to go beyond this and affirm that God influenced natural processes in a way that is undetectable by the scientific methodology? Or could one go even further and hold that God interjected new designs at crucial points in the process that require an appeal to divine intelligence to be explained (the &#8220;Intelligent Design&#8221; perspective)?</p>
<p>Clearly, without specifying what one means by &#8220;evolution,&#8221; as I did in my brief post, you force readers to guess at your meaning, and this leads to unnecessary confusion and misunderstandings. So, here&#8217;s my clarification.</p>
<p>When I expressed my various concerns about the rejection of &#8220;evolution&#8221; as a pastor, citizen, apologist and theologian, I was merely referring to young earth creationism, such as we find with Ken Ham&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/">Answers in Genesis</a>.&#8221; This is the only perspective I know of that dismisses the entire evolutionary paradigm of modern science. From my involvement with <a href="http://biologos.org">BioLogos</a> &#8211; a very informative and important think tank, by the way &#8212; I&#8217;ve learned that, while the creationist movement is dismissed by the scientific establishment and the broader academic community, it is very well funded and organized, which is why it <em>must</em> be taken seriously by those of us who care about the credibility of the Christian faith and the future of the Church. This movement is exerting a tremendous influence on the evangelical church today, and it&#8217;s the primary reason the number of American Christians who reject the entire evolutionary paradigm is<em> increasing</em>, and at a rather alarming rate. For all the reasons I gave in my previous post, I believe this could, over the long haul, prove <em>disastrous</em> for the Church in America (and everywhere else it exerts a strong influence).</p>
<p>I believe there are a number of plausible ways for Christians to integrate Genesis 1 and 2 as well as the broader Christian faith with the theory of evolution &#8212; which is to say, there are a number of ways of understanding how God created humans in his image by evolutionary means.  I think its obvious that the belief that God is the Creator and that humans are made in the image of God entails that Christians must <em>deny</em> that life on earth, and that human beings in particular, are the product of natural processes <em>alone</em>. We must, in other words, <em>deny</em> that naturalistic evolution &#8220;tells the whole story&#8221; about life on earth and about humans. But this doesn&#8217;t mean we must deny that naturalistic evolution is an inadequate <em>biological</em> theory.</p>
<p>There are a number of Christian evolutionary biologists who argue that divine intelligence must be appealed to in order to account for &#8221;irreducibly complex&#8221; phenomena, such as the eye (this is the &#8220;Intelligent Design Movement&#8221;). But I&#8217;ve heard and read plenty of others<br />
(such as those at BioLogos) who give persuasive naturalistic explanations for these phenomena and who argue that appealing to anything &#8221;supernatural&#8221; (e.g. &#8220;divine intelligence&#8221;) to explain natural phenomena is simply bad science. Yet, this group nevertheless confesses, by faith, that God is the Creator who, by means undetectable by science, guided the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>I have my own theory about how God was involved in the evolutionary process (and, in my view, his involvement included warring against Satan and other anti-creational forces). But in terms of my concern about the growing creationist movement, I am not interested in leveraging anything on my own theory or with engaging in any other particular theory. I instead just celebrate the fact that there are thoughtful Christians who embrace science and who wrestle with scientific and theological issues from the inside of the Christian faith<br />
instead of requiring people to declare war on science as a precondition to entering the kingdom.</p>
<p>Hope that clears things up a bit.<br />
Keep thinking!</p>
<p>~Greg</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I guess we&#8217;re on a roll on science topics these last few days.</p>
<p>As a pastor my only concern with the creation/evolution &#8220;debate&#8221; is that those who feel they must deny evolution don&#8217;t make this a hurdle people have to jump over to get into the kingdom. As a fellow member of American society, however, my concern goes a bit deeper, for as Bill Nye says in the article below, having such a widespread resistance to the most fundamental aspect of science &#8220;holds everyone back.&#8221; As an apologists/evangelist, my concern goes deeper still. For the multitude of Christians who leverage the credibility of the Christian faith on the rejection of such a thoroughly proven theory gives multitudes of informed people just cause to not take the central truth claims of Christianity seriously. And as a theologian, my concern goes deeper still. For we are created and called to worship God with our minds by exploring truth, integrating truth, and growing in our understanding of truth wherever truth is to be found, whether in Scripture, in the sciences, in the arts, in religion&#8230;wherever. To reject evolution is to close the door on a wonderful opportunity to grow in our mindful worship of God as we explore ways of integrating it into our understanding of Scripture, of God&#8217;s creation, of God&#8217;s providence, the problem of evil, spiritual warfare, and a host of other issues.</p>
<p>And this rejection is just so completely unnecessary!</p>
<p>Check out the short but provocative <a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/27/bill-nye-slams-creationism/">story highlighting Nye&#8217;s views</a> that has been causing a bit of a stir. And keep thinking!</p>
